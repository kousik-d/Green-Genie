# Green-Genie

-Green Giene is a revolutionary android
application that uses Kotlin and XML to
implement an effective waste management
system. It helps citizens to segregate different
types of waste, such as organic, recyclable,
toxic and electronic wastes, to increase
recycling rates.

-The application features an intuitive user
interface that allows users to easily add and
manage waste items. It also provides detailed
information about the types of waste, recycling
centers, and other resources available in their
area. Furthermore, it allows users to track
their waste and recycling activities.

-We developed two interfaces, one for the
authorities over waste collectors and the other for
citizens. The citizens and trash containers will be
under the authority's control. Both users have
unique logins, and citizens can sort waste into one
of four categories: organic, recyclable, hazardous,
or electronic.

-The citizen will also be shown the closest available
bins for the appropriate rubbish and can place
their waste in those containers. The authority will
be notified of any complaints raised by the public
regarding the bin, and the citizen will receive a
discount on the municipality tax as a result.
